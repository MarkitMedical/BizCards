BizCards
========

Created during the UCSD Mitek Hackathon, BizCards leverages Mitek's mobile OCR technology and Parse's backend 
service to allow users to catalogue and store business cards to the cloud by taking a photo of them with their iOS device.

Note:
Building the project to the simulator will not work, it must be run on an actual device due to Mitek's API.
